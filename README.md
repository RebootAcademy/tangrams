# tangram

Directions:<br>
The object of the puzzle is to fit all of the shape pieces into the outlined shape (called templates in the code). 
<p>Drag the shapes with your mouse. Rotate the square using the left and right arrow keys. Rotate the other shapes using the left, right, up, and down arrow keys and the enter, shift, slash (/), and quotation mark (') keys. </p>


Note: <br>
I made a tangram puzzle to get better at SCSS/CSS and Javascript/Jquery, and because I've been wanting to make this for a while. I limited myself to these technologies and HTML. <br>
<br>
To do:
  <br>make 6 more templates 
  <br>link the numbers to templates
  <br>refactor the movement code so it is more natural (and uses arrow keys only)
<br>
<br>
To maybe do:
  <br>programmatically generate templates and figure out which ones are best for the game and which are easier/harder to solve (maybe using user input to determine difficulty)
  <br>add game mode, where templates get gradually harder?
  <br>make two modes, free play and matching?
  <br>create answers and allow player to reveal them?
