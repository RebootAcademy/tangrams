# tangram
Note: <br>
I made a tangram puzzle to get better at SCSS/CSS and Javascript/Jquery, and because I've been wanting to make this for a while. I intentionally limited myself to these technologies and HTML. <br>
<br>
To do:
  <br><s>make shapes using clip path</s>
  <br><s>make 6 templates total</s>
  <br><s>make navigation to choose template</s>
  <br>refactor the movement code so it is more natural (and uses arrow keys only)
<br>
<br>
To maybe do:
  <br>programmatically generate templates and figure out which ones are best for the game and which are easier/harder to solve (maybe using user input to determine difficulty)
  <br>add game mode, where templates get gradually harder?
  <br>make two modes, free play and matching?
  <br>create answers and allow player to reveal them?
