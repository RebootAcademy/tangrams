# tangrams
Simple tangrams made with CSS and Javascript. I am making this to get better at CSS/SCSS. 


To do:
  <p>make two modes, free play and matching </p>
  <p>build matching mode (shapes start in row w/ template above)</p>
  <p>create shadow outline for matching (use CSS?) </p>
  <p>drop down menu to choose outline </p>
  <p>add game mode, where templates get gradually harder</p>
