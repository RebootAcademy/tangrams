# tangram

Directions:<br>
The object of the puzzle is to fit all of the shape pieces into the outlined shape. 
<p>Drag the shapes with your mouse. Rotate the shapes using the arrow keys. Triangles move with the arrow keys and the enter key, the shift key, the / key, and the ' key. </p>


Note: <br>
I made a tangram puzzle to get better at SCSS/CSS and Javascript/Jquery, and because I've been wanting to make this for a while. I limited myself to these technologies and HTML. <br>
<br>
To do:
  <br>make 6 more templates 
  <br>link the numbers to templates
  <br>refactor the movement code so it is more natural (and uses arrow keys only)
<br>
<br>
To maybe do:
  <br>add game mode, where templates get gradually harder?
  <br>make two modes, free play and matching?
  <br>create answers and allow player to reveal them?
